# Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed for a variety of data processing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction tasks. The project demonstrates an effective blend of techniques for handling imbalanced data, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and robust predictive modeling.

## Features
- Advanced data preprocessing techniques
- Statistical analysis for feature significance
- Implementation of RandomForest and XGBoost classifiers
- SMOTE for imbalanced data handling
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Feature engineering with top 20 impactful features
- End-to-end prediction pipeline

## Key Results
- Detection and handling of data imbalance
- PCA applied to FLAG_DOCUMENT features, achieving 71.1% explained variance
- Model evaluation metrics before and after oversampling
- Predictive analysis with the top 20 features
